	<h1> How do artists get paid from music streaming?</h1>
	<p>
		It is commonly understood that artists make money when their music is being listened to on Digital Streaming Platforms (DSPs) such as: Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, Tidal, YouTube Music, Amazon Music etc... but how does that work exactly? 
	</p>
  <p>
    Do they get a fixed rate per stream, e.g. $0.0012 per stream? No they do not! There is more to it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In a nutshell, performing musicians get a share of the revenue that is generated by the commercial use of their music - i.e. when it gets listened to on DSPs. 
    Where do the money that ends up in the artists' pocket come from in the first place? How is the sum due to the artist calculated?
  </p>
	<!-- <p>
		The music industry is wonderfully complex when it comes to the distribution of revenue along the value chain, from the fans to the artists, songwriters producers etc. via the streaming platforms and other stakeholders. 
		Thoroughly describing all the processes at play would make this article extremely complex. 
	</p> -->
	<p>
    In the following we propose a breakdown of the fundamental principles that dictate how much artists get paid from music streaming. 
  </p>
	<p>
		The value chain in the music industry is incredibly complex. In order to keep things concise and accessible we will only focus on the performing artist recording royalties and therefore do not address other types of royalties (e.g. for songwriters). 
	</p>
	<p>
		Let’s dive in… 
	</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1>Artist & Intermediaries</h1>

Let's first examine who are the players involved in getting the artist's music online and making sure they receive the money they are due. 
</div>

<div id='container' class='container-0'>
  <div id='graph'></div>
  <div id='sections'>
    <div>
      <h3>Getting Music Online</h3>
      	<p>
        	First things first: before any music can be played on a DSP by consumers it has to get there. 
			Say artist X just recorded their great new EP and wants to make it available on DSPs. How do they achieve this? Do they log into Spotify or Apple Music etc. and upload their tracks there? No. 
		</p>
		<p class="highlight">
			Artists do not deal with DSPs directly.
		</p>
        
    </div>
    <div>
      <!-- <h3>Musician sends music</h3> -->
        Artists have to use a distributor who will then take care of distributing their music to DSPs
    </div>
    <div>
        In practice, Artists enter an agreement with a distributor, upload their music to the distributor who will then distribute it to the DSPs. 
        <p>
        	In the case that the artist is signed to a record label, the record label may take care of the distribution on behalf of the artist.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Collecting Royalites</h3>
        When their music is being listened to on the DSPs, the artists are entitled to be paid royalties. The distributor and/or label will then collect the corresponding royalties from the DSPs on behalf of the artist.
    </div>
    <div style="padding-bottom:500px">
        You may be wondering: Where does the royalties money come from in the first place? 
        Essentially, the DSPs devote a share of their revenu to the payment of royalties. This implies that DSPs need to make money in order to then be able to share some of it with the artists. 
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h1>How do DSPs make money?</h1>

Commercial offering may vary from one DSP to the next but there exists two main mechanisms for DSPs to generate revenue: 
<ul>
  <li>Subscriptions. Users of the platform pay a monthly subscription to gain unlimited access to the music on the platform. This is also known as a <em>“Premium”</em> model. </li>
  <li>Ads. In this scenario the users do not pay any money but instead accept to listen to and/or see ads while they use the platform. The advertisers pay the DSPs for the exposure to their customers. This is also known as a <em>“Freemium”</em> model.</li>
</ul>


Some DSPs like Spotify or Deezer offer both Freemium and Premium plans while some other like Apple Music or Tidal only offer Premium plans.

<!-- On legitimate question to ask at this point is: How do these sources of revenu compare to each other? Let's have a closer look on a case study using Spotify's financials for the third quarter (Q3) of 2020.   -->

Let's have a look at how these two types of revenue streams compare, with Spotify's financials for the third quarter (Q3) of 2020 as a case study.


<div id='container' class='container-1'>
  <div id='graph'></div>

  <div id='sections'>
    <div style="padding-top:200px">
      <h3>User base</h3>
        First, Spotify reports that premium and (active) freemium users represent about 45% and 55% of total users, respectively. 

    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Revenue per user</h3>
      Spotify reports that the monthly Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) €4.19 for premium users and €0.33 for freemium users. The ARPU tells us how much money Spotify makes per user each month. 
      <p>
      	The numbers reported mean that premium subscribers generate over 12 times more revenue than freemium users.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3> Contribution to total revenue </h3>
      To put the same numbers in a different perspective: premium subscribers represent around 45% of Spotify users and generate about 90% of the total revenue, which also means that the 55% of ad-supported users only generate about 10% of the revenue.
      <p>
      	The area of the rectangles on the graph represents the revenue per user.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3> How can the DSPs generate more revenue? </h3>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3> Increase ARPU </h3>
      In the case of Premium users, the ARPU is affected by the commercial offering of the DSP. For example increasing the prices of the subscription plans would increase the ARPU. 

      <p>
        The risk of a price increase is that some users may cancel their subscriptions. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      Conversly, promotional offers (e.g. three months free when joining) tends to decrease the ARPU. 
      <p>
        On the other habd promotional offers may help increasing the number of subscriptions, and therefore the revenue.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      In the case of Freemium users, the ARPU heavily depends on the value of the users auditive attention on the advertisement market.  

      <p>
        DSPs do not unilaterally control the advertisment market, so pushing the Freemium ARPU up is difficult.
      </p> 
      <p>What is for sure is that building a great product with which the users will be very engaged will help. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3> Converting Freemium users to Premium </h3>
      Premium users are about 12 times more profitable than Freemium users. Converting Freemium users to Premium may therefore have a huge impact on revenue. 
    </div>

    <div>
      Now you may ask: why bother with Freemium users since they generate so little revenue? 
      <p>
        Some DSPs don't and only offer Premium subscriptions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some do, using the Freemium tier to attract to the platform users who would not buy a subscription outright, and hopefully later "convert" some of them into Premium subscribers.
      </p>
        
    </div>

    <div style="padding-bottom:500px">
      <h3>Increase number of users</h3>
      Last but not least: increasing the number of users on the DSP will mechanically increase revenue, either by increasing the number of subscriptions or by increasing the size of the pool of customers available to advertisers. 
    </div>

  </div>


</div>

<div>
	<h1>Artist Royalties Calculations</h1>
	<p>
		At this point we know that DSPs redistribute some of their revenue to the artists in the form of royalties and we know how DSPs make money. The question is now: how is the artists' royalties payments calculated? 
	</p>

	<p>
		Every month the DSPs add up the revenue they generated and split it two ways: they keep one part for themselves to cover their operational costs (paying employees, bills etc) and redistribute the rest of it as royalties. 
		Although the exact numbers are confidentials, the figures often quoted in the press suggest that DSPs distribute around 70% of their revenue to music right owners as royalties.
	</p>
	<p>
		A direct consequence is that the money pot to be distributed as royalties is proportional to the DSP revenue. 
	</p>

</div>


<div id='container' class='container-2'>
  <div id='graph'></div>
  <div id='sections'>

    <div style="padding-top:200px">
      <h3>From DSP revenue to royalties</h3>
      The dollars stack on the right represents the revenue of a DSP.

    </div>

    <div>
      This revenue is then split it two ways: the DSPs keep one part for themselves to cover their operational costs (paying employees, bills etc) and redistribute the rest of it as royalties. 

      <p>
        Although the exact numbers are confidentials, the figures often quoted in the press suggest that DSPs distribute around 70% of their revenue to music right owners as royalties
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Once the DSP share is put away, the remaining dollars stack on the right represents the royalties money pot. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The artists will receive a share of this pot.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Royalties proportional to DSP revenue</h3>
      The dollars stack on the right represents the royalties money pot of a DSP that is to be distributed to right holders. In other words, the artists will receive a share of this pot.

    </div>

    <div>
      Because the royalties money pot is proportional to the DSP revenues, more revenue = bigger royalties pie to share. 
    </div>

    <div>
      The converse is also true... Less revenue = smaller royalties pot. 
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Revenue Pro-rata of streams</h3>
      The royalties pot is then to be split between all tracks on the platform, pro-rata of their proportion of streams. 

      <p>
    	For example, let's take a track of a given artist. If the track represents 0.1% of the total streams on the platform, it will get 0.1% of the royalties.
  	  </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      If the proportion of total streams is larger, this track will be allocated more royalties accordingly. For example if the track was to get 50% of the total streams, it would get 50% of the royalties pot.  
    </div>
    <div>
      Similarly, if the track was to get 30% of the total streams it would get 30% of the royalties pot. You get the idea. 
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Total other streams influence</h3>
      Note that the share of royalties allocated to a track depends on the <em>proportion of total streams</em>, not just on the raw number of streams that the track got.

      <p> The proportion of streams is simply the ratio of the track streams over the total number of streams:
       \[Proportion  = {Track Streams \over TotalStreams}\]
   	  </p>

    </div>

    <div>
    	If the track streams remain constant and the total number of streams on the platform increases (i.e. the other tracks get more streams), the track's share of stream would be smaller. 
    </div>
    <div>
      Conversly, if the track streams remain constant and the total number of streams on the platform decreases, the track's share of stream would be larger. 
    </div>

    <div>
      In summary, and to nail the point home, every track on the DSP is entitled a share of the royalties pot that is proportional to the share of total streams, which means that it depends on the number of track streams <em>and</em> also on the performance of all other tracks on the platform.
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Track royalties split</h3>
      Once attributed, the track's share of royalties may then be split between all parties who are entitled a share. 

      <p>This is typically when the distributor and/or label may take their cut.</p>

      <p>
      	The distributor/label share is normally defined in the contract between the artist and the distributor/label. The numbers will vary wildly from on case to the next, depending of what agreement has been found between the parties.  
      </p>

      <p>
      	The general principle is that the distributor/label provide services to the artist and that granting them a share of royalties are one of the ways the artist can pay for these services.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      In some cases the distrubutor/label may take a relatively large share. 
      <p>This could for example be justified by the fact that the distributor provides a set of services that the artist does not pay for otherwise, or that the label has made a significant financial investment to produce the recording and is looking to recoupe its expenses from the roylalties revenue. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      In some other cases the agreement would be different and the distributor/label share will be small. 
      <p>
    	  This could for example be the case if the artist has already payed an upfront fee to the distributor or if the label only made a small financial investment in the track. 
  	  </p>
    </div>

    <div style="padding-bottom:500px">
      <!-- <h3>Sticky graph</h3> -->
      The artist gets the remaining share of royalties. 

      <p>Note that for simplicity we are only considering the case where there is a single artist/musician entitled royalties on the track. In the general case there could be several and each of them would be entitled a split of the Artist Share, with the split ratios defined in a contract between all contributors. </p>
    </div>

  </div>

</div>



<div>
	<h1>On the per-stream rate.</h1>
	Per-stream royalty rates are regularly quoted in the press when discussing artists streaming revenue. Although this metric has its merits it often leads to the misconception that artist are payed based on a fixed per-stream rate, which is not true. 

	<p>
		Hopefully this article would have made it clear that there are a number of parameters that influence the royalty payment that an artist may receive from Digital Streaming Platforms, and that a number of these parameters will vary greatly from one track and artist to the next. It is likely that these parameters will also vary over time (e.g. the DSP revenue varies over time). 
	</p>

	<p>
		Given a royalty payment and the corresponding track streams, one may indeed calculate an equivalent per-stream rate by dividing the former by the latter. But in no circumstances is the royalty payment calculated based on a fixed per-stream rate. 
	</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  This was a lot of information to take in, wasn’t it? 

Let’s sum-up what we have gotten to: 
<ul>
<li> Artists do not deal directly with DSPs - they have to go through a distributor or label. </li>
<li> DSPs make money with Subscriptions and selling Ads </li>
<li> Subscriptions generate a LOT more revenue than ads. </li>
<li> A share of the DSPs total gross revenue is dedicated to payment of royalties </li>
<li> Royalties are NOT calculated as a fixed rate per stream
<li> The artist’s royalties for a given track are proportional to:</li>
    <li style="margin-left:2em"> The DSP gross revenue </li> 
    <li style="margin-left:2em"> The inverse of the total number of streams on the DSP</li>
    <li style="margin-left:2em"> Track streams</li>
    <li style="margin-left:2em"> The share of royalties due to the artist, which depends on the artist’s contract with distributor/label.</li></li>
</ul>

If anything the idea to remember is that, at a basic level, the amount of money that ends up in the artist’s pocket depends on multiple of variables that themselves vary over time and from one artist to another. 

In order to get a feel for how this all behaves, have a play with our little simulator below.
